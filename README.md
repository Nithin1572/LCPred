# OVERVIEW:
This Project aims to propose a Machine learning solution for predicting Lung cancer using patients health data.
In this project the data is preprocessed, imbalance data is handled with SMOTE. Out of the 3 ML algorithms used (Logistic regression, SVM, Random forest) random forests emerged as the most effective model, with 86.7% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.85.

# Explains the purpose of the project and its key functionalities (one paragraph).
The purpose of the project is to develop a machine learning system that can predict Lung cancer Diagnosis using the patients data. Project focuses on building a pipeline that can pre-process and analyze features and risk factor while considering the class imbalance and feature corelation. By comparing the Logistic regression, svm and random forest and using Techniques like SMOTE the projects aims to improve the prediction accuracy.

# Describes the steps to set up and run your code, including any dependencies or libraries required.
Steps to run code(including dependencies, libraries):
1. Download the R notebook and the data set from the given github repo
2. make sure both R Notebook and the data set are in the same folder(or update the path of dataset while using it in R Notebook)
3. Run the R notebook (Code to install all the libraries are already added to R notebook)

# Includes instructions for reproducing your results.
NOTE: we used set.seed() for reproducing the results
